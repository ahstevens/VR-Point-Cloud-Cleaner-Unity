An [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/)-based application to view, clean, and annotate 3D point clouds. Developed by the [Data Visualization Research Lab](https://ccom.unh.edu/vislab) in the [Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping](https://ccom.unh.edu) at the [University of New Hampshire](https://unh.edu).

You can refer to the [project website](https://ccom.unh.edu/vislab/tools/point_cloud_editor) for more information.

## 📋 Usage Instructions

See the [instructions](https://ccom.unh.edu/vislab/tools/point_cloud_editor/#instructions) on the project site for more information.

## 📐 Unity Project

This repository contains the project code for the VR Point Cloud Editor [Unity](https://unity.com/) project.

Satellite imagery uses the [Online Maps asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/online-maps-v3-138509), which will need to be purchased to play or compile the Unity project or removed from the code once you have cloned the repository.

## 🔌 Unity Point Cloud Plugin

The rendering and processing of point cloud data is handled by a [Unity plugin](https://github.com/Azzinoth/UnityPointCloudPlugin) written in C++.

## 🌎 QGIS Plugin

A plugin was created to load point cloud files directly into VRPCE from [QGIS](https://qgis.org). See the [plugin repository](https://github.com/ahstevens/VR-Point-Cloud-Editor-QGIS-Plugin) for more information.
